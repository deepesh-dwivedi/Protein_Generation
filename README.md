This project draws its interest in bioinformatics and the innovations brought by the AI revolution in what concerns the study of the primary sources of Life. In particular, our objective has been to predict protein structuresâ€™ enzymatic functions starting from their graph representation, before trying to design graph structural approximations of enzymes through the use of generative models.

Indeed, function prediction and function design are both considered as key tasks in the domain of protein engineering and are at the core of several real life applications such as drug discovery, gene editing, and antibodies therapeutics. In that regard, 2 graph classification and 1 graph generation tasks were performed on the PROTEINS and ENZYMES datasets and a total of 7 graph Neural Network models were designed and compared in the process. The generated proteins were then evaluated using the best performing classifier to assess the quality of the developed generation process.
